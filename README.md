# pui 6A
Assignments 6A for the 05430 PUI course.

## Note: 
For 'Creating a new page', I only did the paper and Figma prototype for the shopping cart page but no implementation before. So I created additional prototypes for the order tracking page, but only implement the shopping cart page with HTML and CSS.
